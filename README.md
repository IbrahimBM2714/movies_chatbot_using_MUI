This is how the chatbot is going to look like.

The OMDb Api (https://www.omdbapi.com/) was used to get information about the movies. 

To access the API and calls to it, head over to https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx and get your own key. After which, all you need to do is paste your key in the api request being made in the fetchApi() function.

To run the code, you would first have to run npm i to install all the node modules. After which, you just need to run npm start.
